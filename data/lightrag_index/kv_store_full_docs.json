I sent them over. They said they would review them within 24 hours. In reality, it's been a week, and no one can help or give any (truthful) estimate of when it will be resolved; they just tell me to 'wait.' I've never seen such a horrible marketplace in my life. I hope those who came up with this can't buy food in a store, receiving a 'document review request' that takes forever to process.\nContext: This is a long review (106 words) from US, rated 1 Stars, with negative sentiment.",

Amazon advertise the product at 61.23 us as soon as I logged in and tried to buy two of the items they were 86.75 for each.There is no way of contacting customer service I've spent an hour going round and round in circles. Very disappointing. I would leave a negative star review for the customer service and what I consider to be really poor advertising. \nContext: This is a medium review (82 words) from AU, rated 1 Stars, with negative sentiment.",

I cancelled my Amazon Prime in February and subsequently found that they had continued to charge me. When I contacted them they refused to give details of who had set up the payment as I didn't have Prime membership at that time. My credit card company cancelled the payment for me and refunded the payments made in June. I have just discovered that Amazon Prime has set up payments again without me being a Prime member!! I have had to cancel my credit card to stop them!!Do not trust Amazon Prime. \nContext: This is a long review (100 words) from GB, rated 1 Stars, with negative sentiment.",
